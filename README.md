simple android app to remind for missed calls.
very simple - will just catch missed calls and every 5 minutes just vibrate and play a sound for some time, 
until the user reviewes the missed calls phone log

i had attempted the same some long time ago, with quite elaborate approach.
this one is very straight forward and still a learning experiment

UI is none, might make something more reasonable sometime
